## HI
I'm ChinaYuanGe, of course it is the net name.

I have been use this name since primary school.

Just a simple chinese working man.

## Gaming
I like to play Rhythm Game like Arcaea, OSU!Mania. 

Also like to play Zombie games, and trying to make a game like State of decay 2 and Zomboid Project.

However is just a draft, still need to learn a lot to finish this project.

Maybe someday you will see this game.

## Coding
Most of time I use C#, Html, JavaScript to write a program, sometimes use C/C++, Java, PHP.

Also know to use MySQL, SQLite.

More like an old school coder...

## Projects
My open source is not much, some of then is too shame to open, some of then have the copyright issues.

The first big project is **ArcaeaScoreChecker**, Most of it is written by C#, helper program is written by C/C++ and Java (it's two helper program).
It aims to enchant Arcaea's Potental system, it shows the calculate details, and provide many powerful feature like:

- Automate read the play result to calc local potental value.
- Automate read the rankboard to adjust local database.
- Automate read the playing, show the potental's change before complete track.
- Automate read worldmode's value to calc the chart constant.
- Edit fragment.
- Generate Score Images.
- Fun functions.

Yeah, it just a hack, but doing non-hacker actions, only aims to potental.

But it has the copyright issues, so I can't open in the public git platform.

Secondary, I'm not finish the mulit languages, so it won't open until I finish it.
