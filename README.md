## HI
I'm ChinaYuanGe, of course it is the net name. I have been use this name since primary school.

Just a simple chinese working man.

## Gaming
I like to play Rhythm Game like Arcaea, OSU!Mania. 

Also I Love to play Zombie games, and trying to make a game like State of decay and Zomboid Project.

However is just a draft, still need to learn a lot to finish this project. Maybe someday you will see this game.

## Coding
Most of time I use C#, Html, JavaScript to write a program, sometimes use C/C++, Java, PHP. Also know how to use MySQL, SQLite.

More like an old school coder...

## Projects
My open source project is not much, some of then is too shame to open, some of then have copyright issues.

The first big project is **ArcaeaScoreChecker**, I run it for 1 year, Most of it is written by C#, helper program is written by C/C++ and Java (it's two helper programs). It aims to enchant Arcaea's Potental system, it shows the potental calculate details (Recent 30 system included), and provide many powerful feature:

- Automate read play result to calc local potental value.
- Automate read rankboard to adjust local database.
- Automate read playing, show the potental's change before complete track.
- Automate read worldmode's value to calc chart constant.
- Edit fragment.
- Generate Score Images.
- Fun features.

Yeah, it just a hack, but doing non-hacker actions, only aims to show potental details. Also it has copyright issues, so I can't open in public sites.

Secondary, this app is for chinese user only until last update(v1.9.1.4), so I am not finish the mulit languages, it won't open until I finish this feature.
